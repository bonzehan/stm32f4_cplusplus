freddi's work helps me most.I add a line "bl __libc_init_array" to run those code for global instances initializing.

little earlier, I found https://answers.launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+question/210821

before that, i've visited

http://myavr.chkronline.de/html_stm32/stm32_eclipse_tut10.html
for C++ issue.

as for SWO, i refer to

https://github.com/karlp/swopy
http://false.ekta.is/2013/12/using-swoswv-streaming-data-with-stlink-under-linux-part-2/

but I didn't use SWO in the end, in fact I found another way to printf in debug
